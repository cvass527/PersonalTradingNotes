{"2025-03-19": "Traded a bit of news in crude. nothing was good though. the meat of the day was j pow. been messing with support and resistance on a rolling 30 minute window with volume. seems to be good for entries and even exits. For starters, i got a fade of fomc. went to a volume profile level and pulled back. retest also went to the same level. then went to baseline \"which i missed\". that was the nuts of the day. could have held that shit until powell presser was over. but here is where things got interesting. soft berg was in there today and puked his fucking guts out. massive soft berg near the highs. market was lighting him up. i got in some, but was too chicken shit to hold. it felt like everyone and their mother was selling. it broke and then maybe a minute or two later, powell was gonna finish talking. another one came in, and i got short after that one. then the market just tanked. one of the best post powell fades i've seen. i really got chopped up in all that action though. i got the 250 fade because it went to another level, but the 3pm fade is insane. i thought i might have seen something wth 70 lots on tns, but it wasn't super clear. i definitely am rusty but there were some good trades i messed up and one i missed (pow baseline test). it was exciting to see trades, but i need a better way to find them", "2025-03-20": "Really kept it light. i think when things go to the meaty part of a bell curve on volume, it's good for a fade on quick moves. seems to be pretty good. got the 250 sweep decently. then the4 255 sweep, i pre worked at a level, went right through it and i wasn't that close. very unlucky, but i was working pre and got punished. don't do that. it would have been great to see that happen then fade. at 5930, i think there was something selling. wasn't drip, but it was definitively red. got a small winner but it wasn't great. i would have won today if it were for that 255 randomness", "2025-03-21": "traded quad witching that was good. i got a nice equity open fade. went right to a level and bounced off. keep looking at that. in es close, there were a couple trades. first, i missed a nasdaq 1k whitebar. it was at about 12 pm. later,  it looked like a group of orders near the top of a zone. traded through pretty quick. i stayed away from 250 sweeep and 255 sweep, didn't look like good enough setups. best trade was 600 lot selling every 5-10 at 5930 onwards. white knuckled it for the 3pm fade and held through because that shit never fades. then after the close at like 30030ish, i noticed it was right at a nice little volume profile and not going down. i got long and that was the play. volume profile saved your ass. o at 53ish i thought i saw a bid stacker. i think there was one in there, but then the 600 came in and i got short", "2025-03-24": "Got chopped around in news a bit. i don't think you can trust a big move as a correct move. 3pm fade went right to a level for the fade. that was sick. worked pretty instantly. got long post 3 just in case there was a crash, but it held. did hold til close, but was onsides at end", "2025-03-25": "didn't win a single trade today. news wasn't great. 250 fade looked pretty good and it ended up working, but it stopped me out. best trade was 127 buying every 3 at 5929 onwards. adjusting filters to see next time. fade didn't work. i did hold for 2 minutes and it looked like it might have worked. maybe it's just a gamble", "2025-03-26": "Didn't see much today. news flow wasn't great. 250 255 just chop. best trade was in nq 900 lot came in. great white bar. es 1k lots not so good. is it berg bro?"}
